# Portfolio — Juan DiB

Production-ready React portfolio scaffold using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Quickstart

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes

- Dark mode is available via the toggle in the top-right.
- Contact form opens the mail client as a backend is not configured.
- TailwindCSS is configured via `tailwind.config.cjs` and PostCSS.

If you'd like, I can run `npm install` and verify the dev server from here.

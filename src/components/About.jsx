        <p>
          I have a background in systems and software engineering, building scalable services and developer tools. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into simple, testable components and iterating quickly with clear goals. My work emphasizes maintainability, observability, and pragmatic trade-offs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prioritize learning and collaboration: mentoring teammates, writing clear documentation, and improving developer experience. I’m comfortable across the stack and enjoy contributing where I have the most impact—often at the API-contract, performance bottleneck, or developer workflow level.
